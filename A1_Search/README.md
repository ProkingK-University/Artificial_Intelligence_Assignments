# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver

This project uses Iterative Local Search and Simulated Annealing algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Problem Description

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It focuses on optimization. In this problem, a salesman is given a list of cities, and must determine the shortest route that allows him to visit each city once and return to his original location.

## Algorithms Used

1. **Iterative Local Search (ILS)**: This is a metaheuristic and a global optimization algorithm. It can operate on problem-specific heuristics, combining them efficiently for finding optimal solutions.

2. **Simulated Annealing (SA)**: This is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. It mimics the process of slow cooling of materials to decrease defects and thus minimize the system energy.

## Running the Code

Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can compile and run the program using the following commands:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
